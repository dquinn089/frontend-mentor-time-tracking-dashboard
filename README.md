## Overview

This is my submission for my tenth Frontend Mentor project, a time tracking dashboard built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to switch between daily, weekly, and monthly timeframes to view tracked hours for various activities.

## My process

This project involved a lot of trial and error, particularly with integrating JavaScript to handle the dynamic updating of the UI based on the selected timeframe. I began with structuring the HTML and setting up the initial CSS for layout and design. Once the layout was in place, I moved on to implementing the JavaScript logic to fetch and display data from the JSON file.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript

### What I learned

One of the key takeaways from this project was understanding the importance of properly managing class states and ensuring consistency in the HTML structure across different sections of the app. Initially, I struggled with updating the DOM elements when switching timeframes, particularly with ensuring that the selected button remained highlighted to indicate the active timeframe. This experience emphasized the need for a systematic approach to handling UI state changes.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I plan to focus on improving my JavaScript skills, particularly in manipulating the DOM more efficiently. I also want to work on optimizing my CSS to ensure better maintainability and scalability in future projects. Additionally, I aim to explore more complex interactivity by working with APIs and learning more advanced JavaScript concepts.
